* Remaining Issues
** General
*** Fix module paths (../../../HISE -> ../../)
*** Soundfile Support is Missing
*** HISE IDE Integration is Missing
*** FaustMenuBar Needs More Buttons
  - [X] Import Faust File
  - [X] Import Faust Library
  - [ ] Open Faust Directory in File Manager
  - [X] Open Faust File in External Editor
  - [X] Recompile
  - [ ] Remove
    Needs mechanism to remove NodePropertyT from NodeTree
  - [ ] Rename
    Needs Remove mechanism
*** Faust Node creates an empty file =.dsp= in the faust code directory
*** Error Messaging
**** DONE Especially: Faust Compiler Errors
Should go to HISE Console
**** TODO Check channel count and report error
**** Error messages when exporting
*** DONE Need to limit faust class characters to ones suitable for class and macro names
especially "-" is a problem
Lots of =DBG= and =std::cout=, =std::cerr= atm
*** Release Build needs testing
Create table with features and platforms/builds and check
*** Polyphony
*** MIDI
*** Plugin
*** static methods for channel count can be used instead of macros once faust 2.50.6 is released
*** processFrame()
*** remove superfluous delay in setup()
*** Performance measurements
  - jit delay
  - jit performance vs. interpreter performance vs. native performance
*** DONE cleanup hi_faust_lib options
*** option dependencies?
there is no c-interface for llvm-dsp yet
or wrap llvm-dsp C-interface

** Linux
*** Control Knobs Don't Animate in Release Build
*** Release Build Segfaults Sometimes When Opening Interface Designer

-> probably not connected to Faust, but a JUCE issue
** Windows
*** LLVM-JIT segfaults When Calling Any Function Into the Faust llvm-dsp Interface
*** DONE Interpreter Backend Fails to Build Because of Missing Function Symbols
Rebuilt faust.dll with those functions
*** DONE Calls into C++ code still fail
Wrap pure C interface instead
*** Cleanup C interface wrapper
Add compile time config option or better use #JUCE_WINDOWS
*** DONE Save Faust Path as HISE Option
*** faust.dll has to be copied to HISE
*** Faust paths when exporting
*** Faust path for dll loading
*** Try llvm-jit again via C-Interface
*** faust.dll paths
*** Interpreter is slow

** macOS
*** Build Errors
*** Faust Library
**** Faust Binary Release
**** brew
**** compile from source
